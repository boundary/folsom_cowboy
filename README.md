### folsom_cowboy, a cowboy based wrapper for folsom

This is an application that exposes folsom metrics via http using cowboy. It is a port of [folsom_webmachine] to [cowboy].

#### installation

Just add the folsom_cowboy to your app, in addition to its dependencies: [cowboy], [folsom].

        %% It's not typical to do this manually, but here's how:
        > lists:map(fun application:start/1,
                [cowboy, folsom, folsom_cowboy]).

You can configure the `port`, `transport`, `transport_options`, `num_acceptors` and `dispatch` in the `folsom_cowboy` application environment. This is typically done in your application's `sys.config`, but can also be specified on the command line:

        $ erl -pa ebin deps/*/ebin -folsom_cowboy port 8888

* `transport` is the cowboy transport module (`cowboy_tcp_transport` or `cowboy_ssl_transport`)
* `transport_options` is the options list to pass to that module (port is handled separately), such as `[{ip, {127, 0, 0, 1}}]`
* `num_acceptors` is the number of acceptor processes to start for the listening socket (default is `100`)
* `dispatch` is the `cowboy_http_module` dispatch tree, which you could use to change the URL scheme

#### api

Query the list of available metrics:

        $ curl http://localhost:5565/_metrics

Query a specific metric:

        $ curl http://localhost:5565/_metrics/name

Create a new metric:

        $ curl -X PUT http://localhost:5565/_metrics -d '{"id": "a", "type": "counter"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"

Update a metric:

        $ curl -X PUT http://localhost:5565/_metrics/a -d '{"value" : {"inc": 1}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"

Delete a metric:

        $ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5565/_metrics/a

Query Erlang VM metrics:

        $ curl http://localhost:5565/_memory

Query Erlang VM stats:

        $ curl http://localhost:5565/_statistics

Query Erlang VM information:

        $ curl http://localhost:5565/_system

#### output
